ruby on rails 
Ruby on Rails is a full-stack web framework optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. It encourages beautiful code by favoring convention over configuration.

GRAPE
This is a REST-like API micro-framework for Ruby. The framework is designed to run on Rack or complement existing web application frameworks such as Rails and Sinatra by providing a simple DSL to easily develop RESTful APIs.

CAMPING
Camping is a small web framework that is a little white blood cell in the vein of Rails. It is an MVC web framework which is just 4kb in size and its built so it stays around the same range.

LOTUS
Lotus is open source software that is well known for simplicity, fewer DSLs, minimal conventions, more objects, zero monkey-patching and the separation of concerns between MVC layers. Made up of standalone frameworks and each one shipped as an independent gem to emphasize the separation of concerns Lotus is one best pick for web app developers.

Rack
Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called middleware) into a single method call. Also see http://rack.github.io/.

REMAZE
Ramaze is a simple and straight-forward web-framework that helps developers in making things simple and complex in a fun way.

NYNY
This is a framework that has all the core stuff to run. Developers can easily extend NYNY via its extension interface. Each NYNY app is a Rack middleware, so it can be used inside of Sinatra, Rails or any other Rack-based app.

CELLULOID
Celluloid is a concurrent object oriented programming framework for Ruby that enables users to build multithreaded programs out of concurrent objects just as easily as you build sequential programs out of regular objects.
